This documentation provides an overview of the example dataset, supported entry types, and details about the data and publications used in this demonstration. Our goal is to help UniSysCat users effectively manage and explore research data using NOMAD. This demonstration highlights NOMAD Oasis , a data management and sharing platform developed as part of the FAIRmat project within the National Research Data Infrastructure ( NFDI ). NOMAD facilitates the collection, storage, analysis, and dissemination of research data, adhering to the principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data management. Introduction \u00b6 This example demonstrates how NOMAD effectively manages diverse research data, particularly in computational and experimental research. It encompasses various entry types, showcasing NOMAD's flexibility and robust data integration features. The dataset used in this demonstration originates from a paper by C. Lorent et al. (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 15854\u201315862) . The paper introduces an innovative experimental setup for spectroscopic analyses of gas-converting metalloenzymes. It allows for adjustments in gas composition and temperature, enabling the preparation of specific redox states for characterization using complementary spectroscopic tools such as IR , EPR , or NRVS . This NOMAD Oasis demonstration illustrates the Research Data Management (RDM) of experiments focusing on the regulatory [NiFe]-hydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha (ReRH). The experiments involve preparing the catalytic intermediate (Ni a -C) using highly concentrated lyophilized samples of ReRH treated either in H 2 or D 2 , followed by characterizing the sample via IR, Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and Nuclear Resonance Vibrational Spectroscopy (NRVS). Additionally, it includes the calculation of vibrational frequencies. The demonstration covers creating entries for different parts of the experiment, uploading raw data files from measurements and calculations, visualizing them in NOMAD, launching analysis tools like Jupyter notebooks with the files in NOMAD, and demonstrating how different project members can collaborate. Supported Entry Types \u00b6 In this demonstration, NOMAD supports multiple entry types, including: Experimental Data: \u00b6 Tabular data files with the .dat file format. Binary data files with the .DSC file format. Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) entries for samples, instruments, and processes, based on NOMAD basic sections. Computational data: \u00b6 Output files from Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations based on the Gaussian 09 package. Research Data \u00b6 The data used in this NOMAD Oasis demonstration come from various sources, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the types of entries NOMAD can handle. The primary sources include: In-situ Infrared (IR) spectroscopy for ReRH_Ni a -C_H . 57 Fe nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) , both measured and simulated, for ReRH_Ni a -C_H and ReRH_Ni a -C_D . Electron paramagnetic spectroscopy (EPR) for ReRH_Ni a -C_H . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Gaussian package for ReRH_Ni a -C_H and ReRH_Ni a -C_D . By exploring this demonstration, users will gain a clearer understanding of how NOMAD can streamline research data management processes, enhance and organize the data, and foster collaboration across UniSysCat. How-to guides \u00b6 How-to guides provide step-by-step instructions for a wide range of tasks, with the overarching topics: Install this plugin Use this plugin Reference \u00b6 The reference section includes a list fo the measurements supported by this plugin.","title":"Home"},{"location":"index.html#welcome-to-the-nomad-unisyscat-documentation","text":"Welcome to the NOMAD Oasis demonstration!

Docker installed on your computer; installation instructions can be found on docs.docker.com/desktop/ . The following instructions are for the Windows operating system. If you are using Linux, please refer to the detailed instructions here or read the NOMAD plugin documentation for all details on how to deploy the plugin on your NOMAD instance. To install this plugin, follow part 4 of the FAIRmat tutorial 13 or read the NOMAD plugin documentation for all details on how to deploy the plugin on your NOMAD Oasis instance. Outline \u00b6 Create a Docker image Add the plugin Update permissions Run the OASIS 1. Create a Docker image \u00b6 We will now create a custom Docker image for your OASIS. There is a GitHub template repository with predefined workflows that can be used for this at github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-distribution-template . To use the template, choose the \"Create a new repository\" option after pressing the green \"Use this template\" button in the upper right corner. Please note that you have to be logged into GitHub to see this option. 2. Add the plugin \u00b6 We will now add the plugin we developed as a demonstration for UniSysCat. To do this, we need to add the following line to the plugins.txt file: git+https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-unisyscat-plugin.git@main We can do this directly from the GitHub web UI. Once this is saved, a workflow will run to create the image. 3. Update permissions \u00b6 Make sure you have Docker installed. Docker nowadays comes with docker compose built in. Prior, you needed to install the stand-alone docker-compose . Download the nomad-oasis.zip archive from your distribution repository to your computer. Unzip the nomad-oasis.zip file. Open Docker Desktop. Open the Windows command prompt and set the directory to the location where you have unzipped the nomad-oasis file. Below is an example for navigating to the directory where we saved the file. Make sure to change this to the directory you specified. cd C: \\U sers \\F air-04 \\D ocuments \\U niSysCat demo \\n omad-oasis \\n omad-oasis Pull the images specified in the docker-compose.yaml (retrieved from the nomad-oasis.zip ). Note that the image needs to be public or you need to provide a PAT. docker compose pull Run it with Docker Compose in detached ( --detach or -d ) mode. docker compose up -d Optionally, you can now test that NOMAD is running with: curl localhost/nomad-oasis/alive Finally, open NOMAD Oasis in your browser to start using your new NOMAD Oasis. http://localhost/nomad-oasis Additional Instructions \u00b6 If you already have a NOMAD Oasis, you just need to add the line: git+https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-unisyscat-plugin.git@main to the plugin.txt in your NOMAD Oasis repository.","title":"Install this Plugin"},{"location":"how_to/install_this_plugin.html#deploying-a-nomad-oasis-with-the-unisyscat-plugin","text":"","title":"Deploying a NOMAD Oasis with the UniSysCat Plugin"},{"location":"how_to/install_this_plugin.html#prerequisites","text":"A GitHub account, which can be created for free on github.com .
